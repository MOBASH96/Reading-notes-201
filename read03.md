 You can also control the borders, margin and padding
for each box with CSS.
 + It is possible to hide elements using the display and
visibility properties.
 + Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and
inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
 Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of
boxes containing text and the leading.

borders and rounded borders.
