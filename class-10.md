## From the Duckett JS book:
+ **“Error Handling & Debugging**:
+ In javascript there is two type of error :<br>
+ **1.programming error** : the JavaScript developers, do something wrong, this kind has 7 type of error such as syntax error each create its own error 
object, which it can tell you the number of line that has the error and gives a description of the error.   <br>
+ **2.User error**: ccurs when the web page reader answers a question incorrectly pushes the wrong button,
or tries to type in a Social Security number when we’re expecting a name.<br>

+ **HANDLING EXCEPTIONS** : If you know your code might fail, use try, catch, and finally.
Each one is given its own code block. <br>
So what is try catch finally tools : <br> 
The try/catch/finally statement handles some or all of the errors that may occur in a block of code, while still running code.

    ### As we say that Errors can be coding errors made by the programmer, errors due to wrong input, and other unforeseeable things.

+ The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.

+ The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.

+ The finally statement lets you execute code, after try and catch, regardless of the result.<br>

+ **Debugging Tips** : <br>
+ Use the console of developer tools, ANOTHER BROWSER, ADD NUMBERS, STRIP IT BACK, EXPLAINING THE CODE 
, CODE PLAYGROUNDS and VALIDATION TOOLS .<br>
