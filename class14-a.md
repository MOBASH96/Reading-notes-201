## Transforms 
+ The transform property in CSS allows us to transform the shape of elements in 2D or 3D space, and thus can be animated 
+ **2D Transforms**: <br>
+ You can move the object from 0 to 360 degrees so that the positive sign symbolizes clockwise rotation, and the positive sign denotes the opposite.
So that the rotation movement becomes the X axis and the Y axis. Also, you can change the size so that the original size is 1, the zoom is greater than 1, and the reduction opposite .
+ SO, you can control several features of the two-dimensional plane,like : Transform Origin,Perspective .<br>
+ **3D Transforms**: <br>
+ As 2-D plane you can add your effect on this , but the deffrint is the you can apply it on z-axis .
if you understand the z-axis direction and how it will replay it easy to add effect as 2-D, like : 3D Rotate,3D Scale,3D Translate, 3D Skew

## Transitions & Animations 

+ You can control the appearance and shape of the object when moving over it, for example, and you can also set points for this movement so that the object becomes animated.
+ **Transitions**: <br>
+ In order for a change to happen within the element, each case must be defined, and the easiest thing is CSS Pseudo-elements we learned already.

   Transitional Properties : It is important to know that there are characteristics that respond to the movement, and these characteristics have in common, such as:
    background-colorbackground-positionborder-colorborder-widthborder-spacingbottomclipcolorcropfont-sizefont-weightheightleft, etc ...
    You can also specify the duration of this movement in seconds or milliseconds , Or you can even control the static time by delay it . <br>
+ **Animations** : 
+ Transitions are a visual pleasure used to delight the user and give the page aesthetic,With the @keyfram you can set the type of movement and its time and set the time.
You can control the number and time of display of the element and the direction in which the object moves.
